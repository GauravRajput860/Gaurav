Reading Files in R Programming Language
When a program is terminated, the entire data is lost. Storing in a file will preserve our data even if the program terminates. If we have to enter a large number of data, it will take a lot of time to enter them all. However, if we have a file containing all the data, we can easily access the contents of the file using a few commands in R. You can easily move your data from one computer to another without any changes. So those files can be stored in various formats. It may be stored in a i.e..txt(tab-separated value) file, or in a tabular format i.e .csv(comma-separated value) file or it may be on the internet or cloud. R provides very easier methods to read those files.
